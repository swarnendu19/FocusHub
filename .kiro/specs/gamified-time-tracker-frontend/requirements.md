# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for building a gamified time tracking application frontend that provides an engaging, animated user experience similar to Duolingo. The application will feature four main pages (Home, Project, Leaderboard, XP) with modern UI/UX design, smooth animations, and gamification elements to motivate users in their time tracking activities. The frontend will integrate with an existing Node.js backend server to provide a complete time tracking solution.
